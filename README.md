This is a next.js project sampling a couple ways to generate infinite scrolls

1. Using Intersection observer.

- This is a more robust solution, and the intersection observer api was created for this purpose.

2. Using window scrollheight

- This is a little hacky, and has it's problems but does do a decent job and is simple enough to understand.
